# RIG - Random Image Googlin'

A Windows Form Application that searches Google for the inputed text and outputs a randomly fetched image you are able to download.
I developed this program in order to learn more about .NET development and speech recognition in C#.
This is a joke application but everyone is free to use and change it.

To use it copy the dictionary.txt file to the compiled file location. This is needed for the speech recognition engine. Feel free to add other words in the document here.
